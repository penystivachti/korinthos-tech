              Regal castles, grand old piles, and the Wild Atlantic Way. Heavenly hikes dotted 
              with waterfalls and lakes in spectacular national parks. Enchanting pubs that play 
              host to a roaring culinary scene and “Craicing” live music. Is it any wonder so 
              many have chosen this idyllic pocket of south west Ireland as their favourite 
              country retreat?
              <br>
              With expansive views over Kenmare Bay and the Caha mountain range on Beara Peninsula, 
              Little Red Bridge is a bucolic remedy to the rat race. Add in a bubbling stream, 
              emerald lawns, flower beds, fruit orchards, and the jaunty red bridge that lends 
              this delightful holiday property its name and you’ll feel like you’ve stepped 
              into a storybook.

            <p>
              Irish-Australian Dennis Farrelly and his British-Greek partner Angela Kipling collided 
              in an Irish pub in Australia over 10 years ago.  Together, they run a successful 
              Athens-based events management company. When Dennis felt the siren call of his Irish roots, 
              they returned to discover the cosmopolitan hamlet of Kenmare and its gorgeous surroundings.
